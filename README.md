# k-Means clustering using Python

The program does the following
1. Asks the user for a filename which contains the point data which is to be clustered 
2. Asks the user for the name of the output file.
3. Asks the user for the number of clusters. This is the parameter k that will be used for k-means.
4. Read the input file and stores the points into a list
5. Applies the k-means algorithm to find the cluster for each point.
6. Displays the points that each cluster contains after each iteration of the algorithm
7. Writes the final cluster assignments to the output file.
